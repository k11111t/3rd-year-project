# Virtual map of Kilburn
 My final year project for my BSc in Computer Science at University of Manchester - dissertation.

 ## Tech Stack:
 - Frontend: HTML | JS | CSS | MapboxAPI
 - Backend: PHP | SQL | JSON

## Description
 
 Web application displays the map of the Kilburn building (Computer Science building on the University of Manchester campus). 
 
- The application provides timetable information and availability of rooms and finds the shortest path between rooms.
- The indoor map model was created based on the floor plan and the internal graph representation of the traversable footpath was modelled in QGIS and exported in the GeoJSON format.
- MapboxAPI was used on the front end to visualise this data, the data is stored externally on the MapboxAPI cloud.
- Optimised the A* shortest path algorithms using a bidirectional search and the heuristic function.
- Created relational SQL databases and shortest path search algorithm on the back end and managed asynchronous calls to the Mapbox API and the database on the front end.
- Applied unit testing to verify the algorithmâ€™s correctness and user testing to ensure the optimal User Experience

## Specific Floor page:
- user can search for a room by its name
- the matching rooms are highlighted <br>
