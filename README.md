# 3rd year project
 My final year project for my university degree.
 
 Web application that displays the map of the Kilburn building (Computer Science building on the University of Manchester campus)
 
 The application uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS for the front end.
 The GIS data was modelled in QGIS and the MapBox API is used to display the geometry.
 Backend is maintained by SQL and PHP.
 
 What the project does:
   - displays multiple floors of the Kilburn building
   - finds a shortest path between two rooms
   - displays inforation about the room - timetable information
